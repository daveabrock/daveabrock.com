<p>Every Friday or so, I typically round up the week’s best links. I wanted to expand on this further, and have a weekly digest of news and perspectives on the .NET world. I’ve always enjoyed the format of newsletters and have found many of them to be lacking. I think the community can do better.</p>

<p>I’ve launched a weekly newsletter called <em>The .NET Stacks</em>. It’s a round up of the last week in .NET, but also delivered with perspective and analysis.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, feel free to register below. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
