<p>This is a short post that might help you.</p>

<p>I wasnâ€™t sure how to use anchor links in Markdown. These come in handy when you have a long post and want to link to different sections of a document for easy navigation.</p>

<p>The nice thing about Markdown is that it plays so well with straight HTML - so I was pleased to get it working on the first try.</p>

<p>First, add an anchor as regular HTML in your Markdown element. Here, it is right at a heading.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">### &lt;a id="MyHeading"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My Heading ###</code></p>

<p>Now, I can link it using a standard Markdown link.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Where is my [heading](#MyHeading)?</code></p>
