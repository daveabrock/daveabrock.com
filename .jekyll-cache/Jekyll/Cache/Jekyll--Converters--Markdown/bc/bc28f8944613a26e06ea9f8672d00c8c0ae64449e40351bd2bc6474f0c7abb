<p>RIP, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-dead.html">James Bond</a>. While watching <em>Goldfinger</em> last night, I forgot about the best feature of Connery Bond films: if you‚Äôre confused about the plot, the villain will explain it all to you right before the movie ends. Ah, the original ‚Äúlet‚Äôs have retro before the sprint ends.‚Äù</p>

<h2 id="is-blazor-ready-for-the-enterprise">Is Blazor ready for the enterprise?</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre writing .NET web apps, you‚Äôve likely aware of all the Blazor hype. (If you haven‚Äôt, it allows you to write web UIs in C#, where you‚Äôve traditionally had to use JavaScript.) In the last two years, I‚Äôve seen it morph from a cute Microsoft project to something they‚Äôve deemed production-ready.</p>

<p>And with .NET 5‚Äîbecoming generally available next week!‚Äîwe‚Äôre seeing a lot of great improvements with Blazor: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-5-preview-8/#css-isolation-for-blazor-components">CSS isolation</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-5.0#blazor-javascript-isolation-and-object-references">JavaScript isolation</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/components/virtualization">component virtualization</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-5-release-candidate-1/#blazor-support-for-ontoggle-event">toggle event support</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/webassembly-lazy-load-assemblies">lazy loading</a>, <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-5-release-candidate-1/#blazor-webassembly-prerendering">server-side prerendering</a>, and so on. These improvements help Blazor catch up to base features of leading SPA frameworks, like Vue, React, and Angular.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre slinging code for a decent-sized company, you <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/is-blazor-safe-enterprise-bet">might be wondering if Blazor is ready for the enterprise</a>. Can you convince your pointy-haired bosses to use it for new, and maybe existing, apps? I think it‚Äôs ready. However, this isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúeasy yes‚Äù‚Äîit involves a nuanced answer. We‚Äôll answer this question by answering some common questions.</p>

<p><strong>Is it another Silverlight?</strong> If you‚Äôve worked in Blazor for a little while, it‚Äôs a tired argument but one you‚Äôll have to answer from those not in the day-to-day .NET world. While a similar concept‚Äîusing C# instead of JavaScript to build web apps‚ÄîBlazor is built on web standards and is not built with proprietary tech that can be suddenly thrown away. It isn‚Äôt a browser plugin like Silverlight.</p>

<p><strong>How will it help teams deliver faster?</strong> Blazor lowers the front-end learning curve normally associated with JavaScript, and allows devs to use their language and their tools to get things done. Blazor doesn‚Äôt <em>replace</em> JavaScript. However, if you‚Äôre in a shop with mostly C# devs, it‚Äôs an obvious productivity improvement. This isn‚Äôt a quick on/off switch, as teams still need to get familiar with core SPA concepts, but the use case for .NET shops is clear.</p>

<p><strong>Is it supported with a good ecosystem?</strong> Because Blazor lives in the .NET ecosystem, it comes with official Microsoft support just like any other product (and, last week, <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/31/dotnet-stacks-23">we discussed .NET 5 support</a>). Additionally, Microsoft continues to devote significant investment in it and has a long history of backwards compatibility. The ecosystem is not as evolved as it is with Angular and React‚Äîthey‚Äôve had a head start‚Äîbut is growing tremendously. As <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/is-blazor-safe-enterprise-bet">Peter Vogel mentioned</a>, Blazor already has 25% of the interest that Vue has (<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Blazor,Vue">from Google Trends</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Does it perform well?</strong> Compared to other SPA frameworks, Blazor‚Äôs performance is ‚Ä¶ fine? It‚Äôll pass the eye test with Vue and whatnot in most cases but there will be <em>some</em> waiting‚ÄîBlazor Web Assembly has a large-ish download size (as its loading .NET in the browser), and Blazor Server has a network hop for each user interaction. The team has <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-5-release-candidate-1/#blazor-webassembly-performance-improvements">made a lot of progress in addressing performance</a>, and AOT compilation is the most popular request for ASP.NET in .NET 6 (and will impact non-Blazor apps in ASP.NET as well). If you‚Äôre dealing with huge amounts of data, you might want to wait for these improvements‚Äîbut should be suitable in most business cases.</p>

<h2 id="dev-discussions-james-hickey">Dev Discussions: James Hickey</h2>

<p>When designing a real production system‚Äîespecially over the web‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot to think about past coding features for stakeholders. For example, how do you manage events? What about scheduling tasks? What about your caching mechanism? A lot of these considerations make you wonder if they should be supplied out-of-the-box with ASP.NET Core.</p>

<p>James Hickey‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel">Coravel project is here to assist</a>. Billed as a ‚Äúnear-zero config .NET Core library that makes task scheduling, caching, queuing, mailing, event broadcasting, and more a breeze,‚Äù it ships with an impressive set of free features‚Äîand you can look at Coravel Pro for a professional admin panel, UI management, health metrics, and more.</p>

<p>I caught up with James to talk about his project, software design, and more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simplicity rules the day. If you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like your solution is getting complicated, then step back or take a 15-minute walk!</li>
  <li>Reuse is over-hyped. It leads to coupling. Coupling more often-than-not causes trouble down the road.</li>
  <li>Abstract I/O from other kinds of logic. Don‚Äôt do direct database or file system access from the core logic in your system. Put that behind an interface.</li>
  <li>If you want to get good at designing code, then get good at knowing how to build unit tests that have minimal (or no) mocking/stubbing.</li>
  <li>Use automated quality analyzers to fail builds when code standards are violated.</li>

<h3 id="lets-talk-about-your-coravel-project-i-love-your-bold-selling-point-near-zero-config-net-core-micro-framework-that-makes-advanced-application-features-like-task-scheduling-caching-queuing-event-broadcasting-and-more-a-breeze-can-you-walk-through-what-caused-you-to-pursue-this-project-how-coravel-can-help-me-and-how-it-works-with-existing-net-projects">Let‚Äôs talk about your Coravel project. I love your bold selling point: ‚ÄúNear-zero config .NET Core micro-framework that makes advanced application features like Task Scheduling, Caching, Queuing, Event Broadcasting, and more a breeze!‚Äù Can you walk through what caused you to pursue this project, how Coravel can help me, and how it works with existing .NET projects?</h3>

<p>Back in the day when I was building <em>.aspx</em> WebForms, I discovered the PHP framework Laravel and loved how it included all these additional features like queuing, task scheduling, and so on out of the box. When .NET Core was gaining traction, I found myself wanting some of the conveniences of Laravel but in .NET Core.</p>

<p>Coravel can help you get a new project up-and-running faster by including things like automated task scheduling, background task queuing, and so on out of the box without having to install extra infrastructure. It works with any .NET Core projects and is (supposed to be) super easy to install, configure and use.</p>

<h3 id="for-scheduling-and-event-management-i-know-a-lot-of-folks-like-utilizing-things-like-triggered-azure-functions-and-service-bus-and-the-likeis-there-an-advantage-to-using-coravel-over-that">For scheduling and event management, I know a lot of folks like utilizing things like triggered Azure Functions and Service Bus and the like‚Äîis there an advantage to using Coravel over that?</h3>

<p>One disadvantage is that Coravel doesn‚Äôt (yet!) support distributed scheduling, queuing, and caching features. One advantage though, again, is you don‚Äôt have to install any additional infrastructure. You can install a NuGet package, add a couple lines of code and you‚Äôre good-to-go!</p>

<p>You can use Coravel and these other products together, too. For example, we often use a distributed service bus to integrate separate systems via async messaging. Coravel can support the internal integration within a system‚Äîlike how you might emit domain events between aggregates. Doing this in-memory has certain advantages. Jimmy Bogard, for example, <a href="https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/05/13/a-better-domain-events-pattern/">has written about using in-memory domain event processing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-by-default-coravel-caching-is-in-memory-but-has-options-to-persist-to-a-database-how-does-this-compare-to-something-like-redis">I know by default, Coravel caching is in-memory (but has options to persist to a database). How does this compare to something like Redis?</h3>

<p>Again, using Coravel you won‚Äôt have to muck around with installing, configuring, and so on with that additional infrastructure. Redis is a fantastic product and I‚Äôm hoping to eventually offer providers for Coravel to hook into Redis‚Äîwhich could make using Redis caching, messaging, and so on even easier. I just need to find some time üòâ.</p>

<h3 id="do-you-view-coravel-as-an-enhancement-over-the-bcl-or-filling-in-for-some-of-its-shortcomings-this-is-part-of-a-broader-thought-about-osss-role-within-net-core">Do you view Coravel as an enhancement over the BCL, or filling in for some of its shortcomings? This is part of a broader thought about OSS‚Äôs role within .NET Core.</h3>

<p>I view Coravel as enhancements over the BCL. I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see these features included in a barebones console application, for example. But when it comes to web applications, these are all features that you‚Äôll need pretty much out-of-the-gate if it‚Äôs anything more than a demo application.</p>

<h3 id="im-a-fan-of-your-loosely-coupled-show-that-you-run-with-derek-comartin-sure-beats-the-tightly-coupled-showa-great-spot-to-discuss-software-architecture-and-design-in-such-a-fluid-industry-are-there-any-firm-principles-you-are-stubborn-about">I‚Äôm a fan of your ‚ÄúLoosely Coupled Show‚Äù that you run with Derek Comartin (sure beats the ‚ÄúTightly Coupled Show‚Äù)‚Äîa great spot to discuss software architecture and design. In such a fluid industry, are there any firm principles you are stubborn about?</h3>

<p>Generally, I stick with using a feature folder approach to structuring any projects I work on. I‚Äôve <a href="https://builtwithdot.net/blog/changing-how-your-code-is-organized-could-speed-development-from-weeks-to-days">written about this before</a> and Derek <a href="https://codeopinion.com/organizing-code-by-feature-using-vertical-slices/">just wrote about it</a>. I‚Äôm a huge fan of CQRS and think it fits perfectly with the feature folders approach.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve given a talk on these topics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36G6-vwwpe8&amp;feature=youtu.be">at the Florida .NET meetup</a> if anyone‚Äôs interested in hearing more about it.</p>
