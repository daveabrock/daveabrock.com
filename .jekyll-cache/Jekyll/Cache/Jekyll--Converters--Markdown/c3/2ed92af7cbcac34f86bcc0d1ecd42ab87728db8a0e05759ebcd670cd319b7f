<h2 id="3-things-to-keep-you-informed">3 things to keep you informed</h2>

<p>The three things you need to know to keep you current and impress your colleagues (the details of which are in this newsletter):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Blazor Web Assembly support is now live! This gives you the ability to debug C# in the browser and use one language for your <em>entire</em> development experience (while you may need to use some interop libraries). Need to work on the front-end, but don‚Äôt have a team with a good JavaScript skillset? Are you a one-person shop too overwhelmed to learn JavaScript? Well, there you go.</li>
  <li>With .NET 5, to be released in November 2020, comes the vision of ‚ÄúOne .NET,‚Äù including Xamarin! A core tenet is producing one .NET runtime and framework that can be used everywhere.</li>
  <li>C# 9 is coming along, which brings a ton of improvements like init-only properties and records (among many, many other things)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="microsoft-build">Microsoft Build</h2>

<p>As you may have heard, Microsoft Build occurred this week‚Äîfrom the comfort of our homes. The real question is: will we ever want to go back, after having this go so seamlessly?</p>

<p>All the content is available for on-demand viewing on the Build site and Channel 9. Here are the keynotes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/23912de2-1531-4684-b85a-d57ac30af09e?source=sessions">Empowering every developer, with Satya Nadella</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="thought-of-the-week">Thought of the week</h2>

<p>For many of us who have been writing .NET for awhile, we can easily split Microsoft into two companies: the Gates/Ballmer years (‚ÄúOId Microsoft‚Äù), with its resistance to open source in favor of world dominance and Microsoft lock-in; and two, the kindler/gentler Microsoft who strives to be open to all, in favor of driving business to its Azure offerings (‚ÄúNew Microsoft‚Äù).</p>

<p>When New Microsoft announced the Windows Package Manager, it was met with quite a bit of skepticism from the community, and caused one spirited GitHub discussion. Leaders in the space, like Chocolatey, don‚Äôt seem to be worried yet, but some folks in the community are asking: why is this needed, with so many community projects out there that already solve this problem (or are further along)? Microsoft points at the issues delivering a native app as well as security considerations.</p>

<p>Microsoft‚Äôs stance of ‚Äúif you are happy with what you use, great‚Äù comes off to some as a little naive, considering how the remnants of Old Microsoft still linger to some folks. As for the community, some patience would help without jumping to conclusions, as Microsoft has open-sourced this and is open to feedback‚Äîand New Microsoft has a track record of working with developers, not against them.</p>
